# Cache Simulation Project

This project implements a cache simulator that allows users to experiment with different cache configurations and replacement policies. It simulates the behavior of a cache memory system with options for direct-mapped, set-associative, and fully associative caches.

## Features

- Supports different cache replacement policies: FIFO, LRU, and RANDOM.
- Allows users to define cache size, block size, and a stream of memory addresses.
- Outputs cache hit and miss statistics along with the hit ratio.
- Simulates cache behavior based on user-defined inputs.

## Requirements

- C++11 or later
- A compatible C++ compiler

## Getting Started

### Compilation

To compile the program, use the following command:

```bash
g++ -o cache_simulation cache_simulation.cpp
```

### Usage

1. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   ./cache_simulation
   ```
   
2. Follow the prompts to enter:
   - Total cache size (in bytes)
   - Block size (in bytes)
   - Number of addresses in the address stream
   - The addresses (in decimal or hexadecimal format)

3. Select a cache replacement policy from the options provided.

### Example Input

```
Enter total cache size in bytes (e.g., 1024): 1024
Enter block size in bytes (e.g., 16): 16
Enter the number of addresses in the address stream: 5
Enter the addresses (in decimal or hexadecimal):
0x1A2B
0x1A2C
0x1A2D
0x1A2E
0x1A2F
Choose cache replacement policy:
1. FIFO
2. LRU
3. RANDOM
Enter your choice (1-3): 2
```

### Output

After the simulation, the program will output the total accesses, hits, misses, and the hit ratio.

```
Cache Simulation Results:
Total accesses: 5
Hits: 3, Misses: 2
Hit Ratio: 0.6
```

## Code Structure

- **CacheBlock**: Structure representing a single block in the cache.
- **Cache**: Structure representing the cache with multiple blocks organized into sets.
- **ReplacementPolicy**: Enum for defining the cache replacement policy.
- **Functions**:
  - `chooseReplacementPolicy()`: Prompts user to select a replacement policy.
  - `accessCache()`: Checks if the requested address is in the cache (hit or miss).
  - `insertCacheBlock()`: Inserts a new block into the cache based on the replacement policy.
  - `simulateCache()`: Runs the cache simulation with the provided address stream.

- Inspired by concepts of cache memory from computer architecture.
